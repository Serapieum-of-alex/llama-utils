Many social species preserve knowledge across generations (culture). Birds are social, communicating with visual
signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and
mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually
for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that
are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce
offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated
by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.
