Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with
domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other
species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human
culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more
before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect
them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.
