Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise, birds are considered
reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are
descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late
Jurassic. According to recent estimates, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Late Cretaceous and diversified
dramatically around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the
pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.[7]
