Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m\r\n(9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than half of which are passerine, or \"perching\"\r\nbirds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the\r\nextinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further\r\nevolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.\r\nThe digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic\r\nenvironments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called\r\nornithology.\r\n",
